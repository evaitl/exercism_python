Python track of [exercism](https://exercism.org).

Sequence for doing 'foo' is something like:

	 exercism download --exercise=foo --track=python
	 cd foo
     emacs foo.py             # Edit source, using online docs at exercism
     ...
	 pytest                   # Iterate until passes
	 pylint foo.py            # Lint out nits
	 black foo.py             # Pretty it
	 exercism submit foo.py   # Submit
